# Potato Disease Classification System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Introduction
Potato Disease Classification System is a project aimed at developing a deep learning model to accurately classify Late blight and Early blight diseases affecting potato crops. The system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze images of potato plants and identify the presence of diseases.

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Mokkshking/Potato-Disease-Classification-System-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-.git

or 

$ git clone https://github.com/shivankursharma018/Potato-Disease-Classification-System-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN.git

$ cd Potato-Disease-Classification-System-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN
```

## Objective
Develop a system capable of accurately classifying potato diseases into Late Blight or Early Blight using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), showcasing the practical application of deep learning in agricultural disease detection.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language used for overall development and integration.
- TensorFlow and Keras: Libraries used for implementing CNN architectures.
- NumPy: Library for numerical computation.
- Dataset: A diverse dataset of potato images, including healthy plants and plants infected with various diseases such as  late blight, early blight, potato scab, and potato leafroll virus.
- fastapi and uvicorn for making a Backend server.

## How to Use
1. *Data Preparation*:
   - Download the giving data set from Potato_Data

2. *Model Training*:
   - Use the provided Training.ipynb  to train the CNN model.
